## Sales dashboard using tableau

The data from the "Orders" sheet includes the following key columns relevant to analyzing sales, profits, and quantities:

- **Sales**: Total sales amount for each order.
- **Quantity**: Number of items sold.
- **Profit**: Profit from each order.
- **Order Date**: Date of the order, which will be useful for trend analysis.

I'll proceed by:

1. Calculating summary statistics for sales, profits, and quantity.
2. Visualizing trends over time using charts.
3. Providing clickable links to the charts.

Let's start by summarizing the data and generating some visualizations.

Here is a detailed analysis of the sales data:

### Summary Statistics
- **Average Sales per order**: \$228.23
- **Average Profit per order**: \$28.67
- **Average Quantity per order**: 3.79 items
- **Maximum Sales in an order**: \$22,638.48
- **Maximum Profit in an order**: \$8,399.98
- **Minimum Profit in an order**: -\$6,599.98 (indicating a loss)

### Trends Over Time
- **Sales**: The trend shows the total sales fluctuating monthly, with several peaks, indicating possible high-sales seasons.
- **Profit**: The profit trend follows a similar pattern, though profit losses in certain months are evident.
- **Quantity**: The total quantity of items sold per month also varies, generally following sales trends but sometimes diverging (indicating lower profit margins).
